**Buildeck** is a Python-based desktop utility designed for **Magic: The Gathering** enthusiasts. It streamlines the process of gathering card data by fetching metadata directly from the Scryfall API.

> **Status:** v0.1-alpha (First Version). This is the foundation of what will evolve into a comprehensive deck-building suite.

## ✨ Features (Initial Release)
* **Bulk Processing:** Paste card lists of any length without restrictions.
* **Multi-language Support:** Toggle between English and Spanish interfaces.
* **Scryfall Integration:** Automatically retrieves Name, Mana Cost, Type, Description, and Power/Toughness.
* **Data Export:** Export your results to a CSV file (Excel-ready) or copy them directly to your clipboard in a tab-separated format.
* **Modern UI:** Built with `CustomTkinter` for a sleek, dark-themed experience.
